# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on PDFs

**Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** is a technology that converts an image of text into a machine-readable format.  
Think of it as a **digital copy machine** that uses automation to transform a scanned document into editable, searchable PDFs.

## Example of OCR on PDF
OCR is mainly needed for **image-based PDFs** (where text can’t be selected) rather than text-based PDFs (where text is already selectable).

## Steps to Implement OCR
1. Sign up with your business email on any of the above tools.
2. Upload your PDF and follow the instructions.

## Troubleshooting
- If some fields aren’t parsed (e.g., in Docparser), raise a support ticket.
- If your free trial expires, you’ll need to subscribe to continue using the service.
