# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on PDF

**Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** is a technology that converts an image of text into a machine-readable format.  
It works like a digital copy machine that utilizes automation to transform a scanned document into machine-readable PDFs that you can edit and share.

## Why OCR is Needed for PDFs

OCR is primarily required for PDFs that are essentially **images of text** rather than **text-based PDFs** where the text is directly selectable and editable.

## Steps to Implement OCR

1. Sign up with your business email for any of the above tools using their official link.
2. Upload your PDF and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Let the tool process your document — OCR will be handled automatically.
4. Save the output — you can now edit and search the text from the PDF manually.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Fields:** Sometimes, certain fields may not be parsed correctly in tools like Docparser. In such cases, create a support ticket to resolve the issue.
- **Free Trial Expiry:** Once the free trial ends, you may lose access to OCR features unless you subscribe to a paid plan.
